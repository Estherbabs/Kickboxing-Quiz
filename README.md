## INTRODUCTION
I created a simplified quiz game for kickboxing lovers called guru quiz. This game consist of 10 questions including the origin, inception of Kickboxing and also some questions on the UFC.

In the game, there is a login page with a background of two kickboxers, after login there is a game area. In this project is to showcase efficiency in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I hope to create a fun game for the users.

#### Typography
 The fonts are imported into the CSS file from *[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)*
- **poppins** has been chosen as the main font for the title text. I chose it because it looks appealing to the quiz users and makes the questions clear. The fallback family of **San Serif** maintains the personal appearance.
***
#### Imagery
I liked the quiz to look sporty and appealing to users who like kickboxing or like sports. the main image used was downloaded from *[pexel.com](https://pexel.com/)*

## Bugs
- The smiley and sad emoji images render a 404 error in the console. This was due to the absolute file path set for the image in the Javascript file. I have corrected this bug by removing the ../ from the smiley and sad emoji from the javascript codes.
