## INTRODUCTION
I created a simplified quiz game for kickboxing lovers called guru quiz. This game consist of 10 questions including the origin, inception of Kickboxing and also some questions on the UFC.

In the game, there is a login page with a background of two kickboxers, after login there is a game area. In this project is to showcase efficiency in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I hope to create a fun game for the users.
